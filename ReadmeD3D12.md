# Samples for Direct3D12

Samples for Direct3D12 are temporarily included in the SharpDX repository but will be moved to the SharpDX Samples repository in a near future.

Currently, there is only a single sample - the famous rgb "Triangle" - ported to SharpDX.Direct3D12 from the DirectX12 SDK.

More samples will follow in the coming months.
